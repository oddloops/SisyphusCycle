# Sisyphus Cycle
A workout tracking website that records personal records for weightlifting exercises. Like Sisyphus, the act of weighlifting is very cyclical, with greater refinements per cycle.

Allows users to create an account, record, and update the exercise name, body part worked, weight lifted, rep and set amount, and the date achieved. 

This web application is hosted using Heroku(https://sisyphuscycle.herokuapp.com/) and JawsDB though an error may occur due to resource allocation being turned off.
